            <h3><b>SHP</b> - Software Developer Intern</h3>
            <b>SHP's Background</b>
            <p>The origin of SHP Leading Design dates back to 1901 when a sole architectural proprietorship was founded
              in the small town of Hamilton, Ohio. SHP has grown from that community-based practice to the diverse,
              multidisciplinary design practice. This evolution has resulted in a culture that marries the personalized
              engagement and attentiveness of a small firm with the deep experience and resources of a national
              practice. From the company's two offices in Ohio and one in Kentucky, SHP execute projects and sustain
              relationships with clients throughout the United States.</p>

            <b>Contribution</b>
            <p>I created an entirely new plugin in Revit from scratch to drastically save time for architectures</p>
            <p>I also increased the performance of and fixed bugs existing Revit plugins</p>

            <b>Growth</b>
            <p>I learned a lot about automating trivial tasks. This would help to figure out what is strictly important
              for the company and myself, and what can be simply automated.</p>
            <p>Since SHP was medium-small company, there was no 'big team' or guidelines. I learned to work on the flow
              and have varied deadlines and expectations. </p>

              endeavors</p>
            <p>As a front-end developer and designer, I increased my design skills. Design is beyond just what is
              seen--it
              is about the whole experience. This would tremendously aid me when I am working on products or anything

            <h3>Lattice</h3>
            <b>About Lattice</b>
            <p>
              Lattice is a React.js application to match hackers based on skill-set.
            </p>

            <b>Why Lattice</b>
            <p>
              Lattice was built to help facilitate team building process in hackathons. Often it's hard to find
              teammates for the project you want to build during a hack.
            </p>

            <b>What I learned</b>
            <p>
              Lattice was a mobile-first design. So, I learned a lot about that design philosophy.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a team project that was fully remote due to Covid-19 restrictions. So, I learned how to be a good
              team-player given those restrictions.

            <h3>House Price Predictor</h3>
            <b>About House Price Predictor</b>
            <p>
              House Price Predictor is a project that takes tabular dataset from Kaggle and creates a model to predict
              house prices in King County, USA.
            </p>

            <b>Why House Price Predictor</b>
            <p>
              I started House Price Predictor to further refine my skill as a data scientist and complete a challenge on
              Kaggle after completing a course on Data Science.
            </p>

            <b>What I learned</b>
            <p>
              As one of my first Data Science Projects, House Price Predictor provided immense growth. I learned how to
              apply the theoretical concepts I learned and developed some 'data intuition.'
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned the practicalities of many data exploratory and modelling techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned to spot the limitations of techniques and how to deal with them. For example, using L2
              Regularization to account for multicollinearity.

            <h3>Foodie</h3>
            <b>About Foodie</b>
            <p>
              Foodie is a full-stack application in which you can add, rate, and review restaurants. It also has an
              option
              to allow fully customizable user profiles.
            </p>

            <b>Why Foodie</b>
            <p>
              Foodie was a personal project aimed to challenge myself and grow as a software developer. Being a complex,
              full-stack application, it provided immense opportunity to revamp my skills and making sure I can stay as
              a
              competent developer.
            </p>

            <b>What I learned</b>
            <p>
              Being one of my first full-stack web apps, I learned a lot of technologies: Node.js + Express, MongoDB,
              ejs
              Templates, Passport, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also significantly enhanced my debugging skills.

          <b>"Peace.</b> It doesn't mean where there is no noise, trouble or hardwork. It means to be in midst of those
          things and still have a tranquil heart.<b>"</b>
          <br><br>
          This is the philosophy I always abide by. If you haven't realized yet, then I am a meditation enthusiast (or
          as my friends say: a freak). Making lots of people happy, have a big impact in the world, and then peacefully
          retire in a monastery is my goal. And a great way to do that is by improving technology. Computers are
          everywhere. Leveraged properly, I can benefit thousands of lives--if not millions or more.
          <br><br>
          When I am not learning something, working on my computer science degree, or crunching code, you would find me
          reading, gaming or watching anime. I also love to hangout with my friends and meet new people! So if you wanna
          discuss something geeky or chat in general, I am your man. I would love to talk with you.
          <br><br>
          For my career goals, I want to work as a developer in the tech industry. I want to eventually end up part of a
          team that would make a large positive impact in the world.
